# Northcoders House of Games API

## Background

<br>

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

## Initialisation Instructions

1. Create the development and testing .env files in the root folder of the project, so that you can connect locally to the test and development databases.

Create `.env.test`:

```
PGDATABASE=<test_database_name>
```

Create `.env.development`:

```
PGDATABASE=<dev_database_name>
```
